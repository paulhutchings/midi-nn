        "\n",
        "We can also see that the sequences in general have a farily large variety of pitches, with most of them containing more than 75% of all available pitches on the Piano (88).\n",
        "\n",
        "The distribution of median velocity is grouped somewhat closely around the middle. Since velocities are 0-127, we see the 63-69 bin leading by a large margin, while the bins to the sides fall off very quickly as we get into the higher and lower velocities. This means that the general dynamic level of all of our sequences is fairly similar, since we do not have many samples with a very low or very high median velocity.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to the standard deviation of velocities, we again see a clsuter in the middle around the 15-20 range, or around 12-16% variation in dynamics throughout the sequence. This reinforces what the median velocity shows us regarding the overall dynamic level of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite having a large number of samples with a high number of unique pitches, the median and std deviation of pitch still remains a strong bell-curve shape around the middle of the keyboard, particularly the range of the right hand. While this is not surprising from a musical perspective, we may have expected a slightly wider curve in the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The last 2 charts are probably the most intersting. They show that the overwhelming majority of notes in the sequences are of a short duration - \"fast\" notes, if you like. This suggests one of two things: one - that the tempos for most sequences are faster, or two - the values of most of the notes is relatively small. The answer to this would have to come from viewing the sheet music for each sequence, or incorperating the MIDI tempo and time signature data into this analysis. This was not done at the time due to being unaware that they could possibly provide additional insight into the dataset, and also to keep the EDA from being too complex/time consuming."

The second shows us that in general, as the velocity increases, the duration decreases.

        "We do see another weak trend of longer sequences usually containing more unique pitches - which makes sense from a logical standpoint. However, the curve starts to come back down as we get longer, resulting in a shape resembling the beginnings of an upside-down U. This could be due to musical forms and structures, where material is reused - increasing the length but not adding to the uniqueness of pitches used.\n",

In other words, the sequences that have a large variety of pitches in them also have a large dynamic contrast. It would stand to reason that those samples would be more valuable for training given their more varied content.\n",

Given the fine-grained nature of several of the statistics, such as number of notes, and the median/std deviations, being more crude when categorizing the data - such as rounding to whole numbers instead of decimals, and binning according to wider ranges, may provide different insights by \"clearing up\" some of the more noisy data."

Such an example is the indication that the general dynamic levels hover around the medians very closely. I believe that this could present a problem where the model does not learn dynamic expression well enough, and as a result produces sequences with little to no dynamic variation."
